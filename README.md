Arduino Traffic Light System

Description:
This repository contains the code and documentation for an Arduino-based traffic light system. The project was created to teach a beginner the fundamentals of Arduino programming and electronics.
Features:
 * Simulates a basic traffic light system with red, yellow, and green lights.
 * Uses a delay function to control the timing of the light changes.
 * Provides a simple and easy-to-understand code structure.
Getting Started:
 * Hardware:
   * Arduino board (e.g., Uno, Nano)
   * 3 LEDs (red, yellow, green)
   * 3 resistors (220 ohms)
   * Breadboard
   * Jumper wires
 * Software:
   * Arduino IDE (https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)
 * Circuit Diagram:

Usage:
 * Upload the code to your Arduino board.
 * Connect the LEDs, resistors, and breadboard according to the circuit diagram.
 * Power on the Arduino board.
 * Observe the traffic light system in action.
Note:
You can customize the timing of the lights by adjusting the delay values in the code.
